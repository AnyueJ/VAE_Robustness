# Deep Convolutional Autoencoders for Robust Flow Model Calibration under Uncertainty in Geologic Continuity
We demonstrate the robustness of VAE handles diverse features and the effectness of combining VAE with gradient-based inversion.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6

MATLAB

Tensorflow 1.13

The MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)

Eclipse
